# Coaching Great Books Courses
## Purpose
This course series aims to introduce best-in-class coaching habits and provide space and community to develop these habits. 

## For Who?
This course series can be valuable to anyone that works with others but is most valuable for those that are expected to mentor and lead others. People attending the classes must be committed to participating. This course series will not work well if people are mandated to attend.

## Why these books?

Coaching is broken down into two categories coaching for performance and coaching for development. The [Coaching Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29342515-the-coaching-habit) will teach us how to develop habits as well as develop coaching for performance skills.  [Difficult Conversations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_14) will be used to develop our coaching for performance skills.

## Overview
This Course series consists of two 8-week courses reading and practicing the lessons from The Coaching Habit and Difficult Conversations.  It involves a commitment of an hour a week of direct involvement, as well as, practicing during the participant's work and private engagements.

## Outline
Each week the group will meet for a 1-hour meeting with the following agenda:

### Meeting Agenda
* How did it go (25 mins)?
    
    Discuss how practicing the previous chapter went in the week, when we used it, whether it was effective, and what was challenging about practicing.

* Read the next section (15 mins)

    Everyone goes to their book and reads the next planned section.  And waits quietly while everyone else finishes

* Discuss how we will practice in the next week (15 mins).
   
   Discuss how and when we expect to practice our new habit over the week before the next meeting.

### Meeting Facilitator Notes
* How did it go?
  * The facilitator should start this section with the simple question, "What's on your mind?" 
  * The facilitator should allow the conversation to evolve.
  * The facilitator should look for opportunities to engage with individuals that are not participating.
* Read the next section
  * The facilitator should instruct everyone to read the next section.
  * The facilitator should instruct the participants to notify the group when they are done reading.
    * One good way to do the notification is for everyone to shut off their camera while they are reading and turn it on when they are back.
  * The facilitator should also make a shared notetaking space, for people to share thoughts on the reading as they are reading and as they finish
* Discuss how we will practice in the next week
  * The facilitator should have everyone skill the shared not taking space and then ask "What's on your mind?"
